description: A simple weekly To-Do web application that allows users to create to-do lists. This application was made using Ruby on Rails and external API with authentication. The user can create user accounts, sign in and create to-do lists and to-do items to remind them to get things done! If the user does not complete the to-do item within 7 days, it will automatically delete the item using rake automation. (add heroku and github links & change picture)
