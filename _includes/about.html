                    I am a front-end developer with experience in Ruby on Rails applications. With a passion for beautiful and functional design, I want to create things that are meaningful. That's what I enjoy most about working as a developer, the ability to take an idea and make it a reality. The tech industry is ever-evolving which makes it so fascinating and exciting for me to continuously learn and grow. <br /><br />

                    When I'm not coding, I love traveling, exploring new places and taking pictures of everything and anything. It's my main source of inspiration to fuel creativity. I'm also a huge foodie who is a fitness enthusiast - I love to workout so I can eat delicious food. Striving to live a happy and healthy life, I hope to make a positive impact in the world. <br /><br />
