                        I am a front-end developer with experience in Ruby on Rails applications. With a passion for functional and beautiful design, I want to create things that are meaningful. That's what I enjoy most about working as a developer, the ability to take an idea and make it a reality. The tech industry is ever-evolving which makes it so fascinating and exciting to continuously learn and grow. <br /><br />

                        When I'm not coding, I love to travel and explore new places. I am an avid foodie who is also a fitness enthusiast. I workout so I can eat delicious food without feeling guilty! I strive to live a happy and healthy life and want to make a positive impact in the world. <br /><br />
